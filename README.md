# PersonalFinanceTracker
The project aims to visualize the financial data in an intuitive dashboard to help users better understand their financial health, identify spending patterns, and make informed decisions about their finances. By creating a simple and user-friendly application, we hope to empower college students to gain better control over their personal finances.
